                        <p>In Cuba, thousands of years ago, natives such as the Tainos were engaged in agriculture, but it was a Spanish colony until the 19th century after Christopher Columbus came to Cuba in the 15th century. From the beginning of the 16th century, Spaniards imported black slaves from Africa, and by the 19th century, the number of black slaves imported to Cuba reached one million. In the 17th and 18th centuries, blacks staged several liberation struggles, but they ended up with harsh Spanish oppression. The closeness between Cuba and the United States had so much influence on Cuba's history that the United States constantly tried to dominate Cuba. In the 19th century, Carlos Manuel de Cespedes and José Martí each fought a war of independence, but Spain refused to allow Cuban autonomy, and military ruler Valeriano Weyler brutally suppressed it.</p>
