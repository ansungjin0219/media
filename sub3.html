                        <dd>Cars in Cuba mainly consist of vintage, American-made automobiles that date back to as early as the 1940s. These commodities come from large companies, such as Chevrolet, Buick, and Ford models. The reason behind this abundance of old-fashioned cars was due to the U.S.</dd>

                        <dd>Despite the tourist appeal to the antique vehicle, Cuba's cars are probably one of the most culturally stimulating aspects of the country. Vintage American cars still live in the heart of Havana, which is mainly used as taxis. The automobile industry in Havana, a famous tourist city, relies heavily on the interests of tourists who spend $20-$30 on taxis to get a full "vintage car experience."</dd>

                    <p>It may be convenient to own a car, but the streets of Cuba are often relatively quiet. Because of its communist regime, private ownership of materials such as cars was illegal in Cuba from 1959 to 2011.  As a result, the vast majority of locals have never owned a car personally, or if they did, they would have owned it before 1959.
